# AWS S3 Explorer

This is an S3 Explorer for AWS. It provides a simple and straightforward way for users to login using SSO and explore available S3 Buckets. Everything is done in the browser and requires only minimal setup using either [AWS Cognito](https://) or [Authress](https://authress.io).

This is an open source project managed by the [Authress Engineering team](https://authress.io).

Rhosys hosts an explorer to use out of the box for the community. For obvious security reasons, this is a UI only tool, and makes ZERO api calls to anywhere other than AWS. The following is a link to that explorer. However, if for some reason, other than security there is a benefit to hosting a clone of this, feel free to fork the repo and make any necessary changes. Alternatively, please contribute!
### Go to the => [AWS S3 Explorer](https://console.rhosys.ch/)

### Or => [Deploy a white-labeled version to your custom domain](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-west-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:922723803004:applications/S3-Explorer)

<!-- ## Display Options

This application allows visitors to view the contents of a bucket via its folders or by listing out all objects in a bucket. The default view is by folder, but users can choose Initial View: Bucket in Settings to display all objects in the bucket. Note that viewing an entire bucket that contains many objects could overwhelm the browser. We've successfully tested this application on a bucket with over 30,000 objects, but keep in mind that trying to list too many objects in a browser could lead to a poor user experience. -->

## Troubleshooting
If you run into any problems just try running through the suggested [Troubleshooting steps](./docs/troubleshooting.md) and if that doesn't help, [file an issue](https://github.com/Rhosys/aws-s3-explorer/issues), we are usually quick to respond.
